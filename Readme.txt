Here is a description of how this "3D Robot Minesweeper" web app was built and the environment it's designed for.

ü§ñ How This Web App Was Built
This is a highly complex single-file, client-side game application. The entire app‚Äîincluding the 3D renderer, game logic, character controller, and UI‚Äîis contained within one HTML file and runs entirely in the user's web browser.




Structure (HTML): The HTML skeleton is composed of several key layers:

A main <div> (#container) that holds the 3D (WebGL) scene.

A <div> (#input-modal) that appears first, asking the user to select between keyboard or touch controls.


A full set of on-screen touch controls (#touch-controls), including a joystick area and action buttons, which are shown for mobile users.





Various overlay <div>s for the UI, such as the level/mine count , control info , and a loading screen.



Styling (CSS): The app uses a hybrid styling approach:


Tailwind CSS: The framework is loaded from a CDN to handle the layout and styling of the UI modals and buttons.


Custom CSS: A large internal <style> block defines all the custom visual elements, particularly the layout and appearance of the on-screen joystick and action buttons for the touch-based interface.




Logic (JavaScript): The app's functionality is built in a single <script type="module"> tag  and is centered around the Three.js library.


3D Rendering: Instead of HTML DOM or 2D Canvas, this game uses Three.js to create a full 3D scene rendered with WebGL. This includes 3D models, lighting, and shadows.






Character Controller: The app's logic is encapsulated in a large CharacterController class. This class manages:


3D Model: Loading and animating an external 3D robot model (.glb) as the player's avatar.



Dual Input: It supports two complete control schemes:


Keyboard/Mouse: WASD for movement, mouse (via Pointer Lock) for camera, and keys (E, F/R) for reveal/flag actions .




Touch: An on-screen joystick for movement and dedicated buttons for "REVEAL," "FLAG," "JUMP," etc..





Camera: A dynamic camera system that can switch between a "follow" cam and a "top-down" view.


Minesweeper Logic: It contains a complete procedural engine for Minesweeper. The startNewGame and createMinefield functions generate a new board, place mines, and calculate numbers. The recursiveReveal logic handles the classic "flood fill" for empty squares.



Dynamic Textures: A key feature is that it dynamically generates its own textures. It uses a createTileTextures function to draw numbers , flags , and mines onto new, in-memory <canvas> elements and then converts those canvases into Three.js textures .





üñ•Ô∏è Running Environment & Specifications
Software: This app requires a modern web browser that supports WebGL (for Three.js) and ES6 Modules (for the import syntax). Standard browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge will work.

Hardware: Unlike the previous 2D games, this app is computationally intensive.

It uses 3D graphics, real-time lighting , and shadows, which rely heavily on the device's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).


While it will run on many modern smartphones and computers, older or low-end devices without a capable GPU may experience a low frame rate or graphical issues.

Network:

Client-Side Only: The game logic, level generation, and rendering are all 100% client-side. It does not require an internet connection to play.

First-Time Load: An internet connection is required for the initial load to download several assets:

The Tailwind CSS file.

The Three.js library and its GLTFLoader.


The 3D robot model (.glb file).

Offline Use: After these assets have been downloaded and stored in the browser's cache, the entire game can be loaded and played completely offline.
